I have just wrapped up my fourth project through Flatiron School, the JavaScript Project.

[Sightwords - Frontend](https://github.com/nlewis84/sightwords_frontend)
[Sightwords - Backend](https://github.com/nlewis84/sightwords_backend)

## Sightwords
In planning for this project, I wanted to do a throwback to the good ole CLI days and build some slightly more complicated logic behind the scenes. I have a son in Kindergarten and we practice learning to read with sightwords every night. This seemed like a cool opportunity to build something that would be kid friendly, accessible, and applicable in daily life.  

### The Process
As with every other project, I started with some pretty grand plans and ended up paring it down to deliver a timely MVP. I was going to use an api to fetch the "pronunciation" sound files, then pass them into the database. I had trouble finding a free api for this, and instead opted for just grabbing the audio urls from www.dictionary.com for my seed data and any subsequent additions.

I can also see how this app functionality could be expanded to gamify it more….adding point for correct words and a timer. Ultimately, I decided to forego these features for the time being.

### Getting Started
This was the hardest part for me. I also learned that I do better to have a rough sketch of the actual layout of objects before coding, so using a sketch tool and laying out the CSS was important as a beginning step for me. 

Building the core logic was tricky….there was a solid day where I felt like I just stared at the screen and really got no work typed up. I think that was vital though, because I learned a LOT of ways that things would not work the way I wanted. In the end, I was super proud that I had found a solution to my problem.

### Advice for future students
At the time that I did this project, March 2020, this project has significantly less constraints and specs than the Rails project. Know that the intent of this is not to necessarily keep scaling up your project in size and complexity. You are taking a new set of skills and applying them to a new framework. Focus on getting an MVP and buckle up, because React is up next!
