I did it!

The first step is always the hardest. I've spent the last month working through [Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101W9CAEAdclZWRn8G/) on Udemy.com and it has been a blast. I began researching my options for bootcamps about 3 weeks ago and locked in on Flatiron School. Since I am still a full time public school educator, my schedule flexibility is pretty rigid. Flatiron offered quality course material at a pace that worked for me.

I've heard quite a bit about imposter syndrome, and I finally got hit with my first big wave of it. I am a musician and a teacher. I have been doing both of those things for over 20 years. I am a huge proponent of Growth Mindset (cc: Carol Dweck) and I am the educator and musician that I am today because I constantly strive to learn more and improve my craft. When I think about what I'm doing right now with my code learning, *it feels like I'm drinking from a fire hose*! 

I started up the first module at Flatiron and, would you look at that! We are learning about git and all of the commands to setup a repo, commit files, push/pull/clone/fork.....you get the idea. I have a casual understanding of these things. Then we go on to learning Ruby, a language I've only heard of because I see it on GitHub profiles and developer websites. 

At this point, panic sets in and I start thinking "What have I done?"

The great news for me (and for you, if this hits close to home) is that within a few lessons, I realize that Ruby is not all that different from JavaScript, and would you look at that....3 hours have passed and I'm no longer an imposter!

Part of me knows that I will have ups and downs like this, especially since I am changing careers. Learning something new as a musician or educator was predictable and familiar. I have such a strong base knowledge in that expertise that I could easily work through any obstacles. I'm not there yet with coding, but I plan on being there soon.
