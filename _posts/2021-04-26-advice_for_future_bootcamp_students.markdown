Have you made the decision to join a tech bootcamp and jumpstart your career? Congratulations! You are in for an exciting time of learning some extremely cool skills and building amazing products to make peoples' lives easier. I am just wrapping up my time at the Flatiron School web developer bootcamp. I chose to do the self-paced online path with Flatiron and really enjoyed every step of it. Here are a couple of things that I picked up on along the way, and I hope that they help make your journey a smooth one.

## The Beginning
When I began, I had a very cursory knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is a lot to unpack right at the beginning. You may be learning to use Git and backend languages (like Ruby), and it could potentially feel VERY foreign to you. That's okay! Within a few hours of reading documentation and watching YouTube tutorials, you will find your footing. Do not get disheartened!

## Setting up your environment
This was the worst for me! Noone knows exactly what setup you have and what is going to work best for you, so there is a bit of trial and error here and it will probably feel like you have been thrown into the deep end without knowing how to swim. Pump your legs and flail your arms until you either start floating or make it back to the edge of the pool! This can be a significant hurdle, but very soon you will be happily coding your days away.

## Study Groups and Pair Programming
I regularly attended virtual study groups over content WAY above my head. I attended a local Dallas React meetup every month (I had no idea what they were talking about most of the time). I talked to folks on Slack regularly, tried to solve their problems, and sent them my problems for help. I jumped into screen shares with fellow students across the globe. No man is an island. As you immerse yourself in conversation, you will find that as you approach the stumbling blocks of other developers, you have seen them struggle to find a solution. There were several times where I got stuck on something, referred back to my notes from a meetup I was completely lost with, and found the solution that I needed!

## Plan out EVERYTHING
Try to spend as much time as possible with the planning of your projects. Think really hard about exactly what data you want present in your models. Purposely wireframe what you want your specific pages to look like. Write a bulleted list to demonstrate where you want containers and components in React. Figure out what you want to name your routes in RoR. You may run into a roadblock when you actually start coding your project, but you will save yourself from heartache if a majority of your time is spent on planning. Plan out when you are going to study. Decide on a schedule for school work, and stick to it! Find study groups and put them on your calendars. The more intentional you can be with your planning, the more ready you will be for the unseen challenges in your future.

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product
You are taking a new set of skills and applying them to a new framework almost constantly in bootcamp. Focus on getting a minimum viable product out for your projects. The same goes for your assignments. If you want the user's name at the top of a webpage, just type "Username" there, then go about figuring how you will replace that text with what you want. While it would be really cool to add a counter to keep track of the points a user scores in your next big game, that means assigning point values. Build the game structure first and add the point system later as a different branch. Keep your eye on the prize, meet the specs of your projects, and as you reach the end of your time in bootcamp, go back to those old projects and really dive deep on adding all the features you dreamed of.

## Growth Mindset
Overall, keep positive and one of the most important words you can know is "yet". You don't know how to write routes in ruby, yet. You don't really understand how state works with React, yet. Keep pushing and reading and talking to other developers, and you will soon be able to use all the things you didn't know yet.
